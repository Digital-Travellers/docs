<Text>
  When thinking about the project structure for the frontend project, it has
  been complex to define how to implement an Hexagonal Archictecture and DDD for
  it. That is because the newer frontend frameworks have not been designed
  taking into account this <strong>development</strong> patterns, rather
  thinking more about the <strong>UI</strong>.
</Text>

<Text>
    However, the project structure that has been decided mixes the patterns used
  nowadays for frontend applications, hexagonal architecture and DDD. Basically,
  the goal is to share an application core which is application independent.
  This core will follow be developed in a DDD-style, in which each internal
  module will follow an hexagonal architecture approach. This concepts are
  explained in later sections.
</Text>

<Text>
  Now, the core could be it's own single repository and later could be imported
  as a package where it is needed. However, this would imply having to modify
  different repositories at the same time for a ticket that would involve
  changes in the core as well as in the ui application.
  <br />
  One of the goals is to also provide a better developer experience and having
  to develop in two different repositories, waiting for packages to be posted
  and then updating where they are needed, would not provide an enthusiastic
  one.
  <br />
  Therefore, a monorepo approach would simplify most of these issues. Not only
  that, but the TypeScript environment simplifies the maintenance of
  monorepositories. Furtheremore, there are many tools that even improve the
  developer experience of monorepos, one of them being Nx.
  <br />
  Nx is a build system that has first class support for monorepoesitories. Also,
  it includes many functionalities that can improve and simplify the management
  of the monorepo.

  In this section, the different nx packages will be explained. Keep in mind
  that there may be projects that have not been yet added!

<H3 content="Context package" />

<Text>
  As explained previously, the context will be the core of our project. It will
  follow a domain driven design, since it will allow us to separate easily the
  different modules or domains. Then, each domain will be structured using an
  hexagonal architecture schema, having the domain, application and
  infrastructure layers.
</Text>

<Text>
  Inside each module, we will have the three layers: domain, application and
  infrastructure. It is important that each module follows the same patterns and
  agreements:
</Text>

- <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Domain layer</strong>: Will contain the <code>Value Objects</code>,
  <code>Entities</code>, <code>Repositories</code> contracts... Each "group" of
  classes or entities should be in their own folder. 
</Text>
- <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Application layer</strong>: Will contain the <code>Use Cases</code>
  from our <strong>module</strong>. There's no need to keep them in a single
  folders, as most likely it will be a standalone file.
</Text>
- <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Infrastructure layer</strong>: Will contain the concrete
  implementation of the domain repositories. This implementations will most
  likely be used to perform queries in the UI layer. Because of this fact,
  inside the infra layer, each module will have a <code>querier</code> and a
  <code>queries</code> folder. Inside the <code>queries</code>, the concrete
  implementations of the repository for fetching/posting data will be defined;
  while in the <code>querier</code> will be a <strong>functional module</strong>
  {' '}that will provide the <em>queries</em> that will be used in the UI layer.
</Text>

<Text>
  There may be many contexts inside the context package (i.e.
  <code>auth</code>,{' '}<code>user</code> and so on).
  <br/>
  Below is a list of usefull commands for the project
</Text>

<H4 content="Generate a new context package" />

```sh
nx generate @nrwl/js:lib context/lib-name \
  --bundler=esbuild \
  --minimal \
  --test-environment=node
```

<Text>
  Replace <code>lib-name</code> with the context package that you want to
  create. By using the given arguments, you will make sure to create the expected
  package inside the context.
