<H1 content="Contributing to the documentation" />

<Text>
  The documentation is written using the docusaurus, a static-site generator
  that uses React under the hood (while allowing us to use React aswell). No
  only that, but has many benefits and utilities so that teams can develop
  proper documentation.

<H3 content="Component based docs" />

<Text>
  A good thing about docusaurus is that allows you to use React inside Markdown
  (in <code>.mdx</code> files). This allows us to have a more flexible
  documentation, but it is also a challenge for use to keep the style equal on
  each page.

  With this in mind, the structure of this repository has been set so that
  documentation pages are written using the little system design of components
  that resides inside <code>@src/components/shared</code>.  
  The goal of this folder is to store the components that are reusable all
  around the documentation, such as the headers, this text that you are reading
  and so on.
  Also, the goal is that it has a similar look to what the front-end application
  will look, in order to have a more unified style. At the same time, it is
  important that, whenever a member modifies a component or creates one, such
  changes are reflected in the documentation.

  In order to style the components, this project uses TailwindCSS, which lighter
  and efficient way of using CSS. You can find more information in their{' '}
  <Link href="https://www.tailwind.css/docs">documentation</Link>.
