<Text>
  Working agreements are a set of guidelines that a team agrees to follow in
  order to work together effectively. Having well-defined working agreements is
  particularly important for async and remote teams for the following reasons:
</Text>

1. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Establishes clear communication protocols</strong>: Working agreements
  can help establish clear communication protocols, including expectations around
  response time, communication tools, and channels. This can help ensure that
  everyone is on the same page and knows how to communicate effectively with each
  other.
</Text>
2. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Builds trust</strong>: Working agreements can help build trust among team
  members by setting clear expectations and norms around how work is done. This can
  help foster a sense of accountability and reliability among team members, which is
  essential for remote and async teams where there is less opportunity for in-person
  interactions.
</Text>
3. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Improves collaboration</strong>: Working agreements can help improve
  collaboration by establishing clear roles and responsibilities, including
  expectations aroun participation in meetings and decision-making processes. This can
  help ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and that there is no
  confusion or duplication of efforts.
</Text>
4. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Increases productivity</strong>: Working agreements can help increase
  productivity by reducing the time and effort spent on coordination and communication.
  When everyone is on the same page and knows what is expected of them, work can
  proceed more efficiently and effectively.

  It has been agreed to meet bi-weekly with our mentor (<code>@mangasf</code>)
  through Google Meet. The meeting link will be sent in our discord channel
  before starting the meeting. Additionally, the developers will meet regularly
  in order to ensure a proper collaboration and that the project is progressing
  as expected.
  <br/>
  In order to maximize the effectiveness of team meetings, it's important for all
  developers to attend whenever possible. Additionally, if any deadlines or homework
  are assigned prior to a meeting, developers should make every effort to meet those
  requirements before the meeting takes place. This helps to ensure that the meeting
  can be as productive and efficient as possible, and that everyone is fully
  prepared to participate and contribute to the discussion.

<Text>
  To increase visibility into the progress of our project, we have made the
  decision to create a single shared project that can be accessed by everyone
  involved, from developers to mentors. This approach will allow for a clearer
  and more comprehensive view of the project's progress, enabling all team
  members to stay informed and up-to-date. By centralizing our project
  management in this way, we can ensure that everyone is working towards the
  same goals and has a better understanding of how their contributions fit into
  the larger picture.

<H4 id="project-views" content="Project views" />

<Text>Here's an explanation for the different views:</Text>

- <Text noMargin>
  <Link href={`${PROJECTS_URL}/3`}>Board</Link>: This view contains a typical
  scrum/kanban board. The goal of this view is to provide visibility to the
  active tickets as well as those that are in the backlog. Regarding the
  different colums, their are a reference to the status of the ticket, which is
  explained more in depth in the next sections.
</Text>
- <Text noMargin>
  <Link href={`${PROJECTS_URL}/1`}>Backlog</Link>: This view will contain a list
  of the tickets that are in the backlog, giving more visibility to the tickets
  that are yet to be done and not in the ready status.
</Text>

<H4 id="ticket-fields" content="Ticket fields" />

<Text>
  To improve the efficiency and clarity of our ticketing system, it's important
  that all tickets are properly tagged with the corresponding labels. This ensures
  that team members can quickly and easily understand the nature of each ticket,
  without having to read through lengthy descriptions or search for relevant
  information. By using clear and consistent labelling, we can streamline our
  workflow and reduce the time and effort required to manage tickets. So be sure
  to tag your tickets carefully and accurately to ensure that everyone has the
  information they need to get the job done right.
</Text>

<H5 id="ticket-fields-status" content="Status" />

<Text>
  The status of a ticket is a quick and easy way to understand where a
  particular task or issue stands in the overall workflow. It provides a clear
  indication of whether the ticket is open or closed, in progress or waiting for
  action, and so on.
</Text>

- <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Backlog</strong>: Tickets awaiting priorization
</Text>
- <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Ready</strong>: Tickets ready for work to begin
</Text>
- <Text noMargin>
  <strong>In Progress</strong>: Ticket actively being worked on
</Text>
- <Text noMargin>
  <strong>In review</strong>: Tickets awaiting review or approval
</Text>
- <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Done</strong>: Task completed and closed
</Text>

<H5 id="ticket-fields-project" content="Project" />

<Text>
  The project field is none other than the repository in which the issue of the
  ticket has been created. So, basically, we can understand a ticket as an issue
  of a repository, which will later have a pull request and at some point in the
  future it will be merged
</Text>

<H5 id="ticket-fields-priority" content="Priority" />

<Text>
  The priority label will help us organise and ensure that we, as a team, focus
  on the same thing. Here's the list of the different priorities and their
  meaning:
</Text>

1. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Urgent</strong>: Requires immediate attention, critical
</Text>
2. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>High</strong>: Important, needs prompt attention
</Text>
3. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Medium</strong>: Requires attention, not urgent
</Text>
4. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Low</strong>: Not critical, can wait
</Text>
5. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Trivial</strong>: Very low priority, negligible impact.
</Text>

<H4 id="ticket-development" content="Ticket development" />

1. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Ticket creation</strong>: A team member creates a new ticket in the
  project, describing the task or issue that needs to be addressed. The ticket
  will include a title, description, and any relevant details or attachments.
</Text>
2. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Ticket assignment</strong>: The ticket is assigned to a team member
  who will be responsible for completing the task or resolving the issue.
</Text>
3. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Ticket status</strong>: The ticket is moved to the appropriate status
  column on the project board, such as <code>Backlog</code>, <code>Ready</code>,
  or <code>In Progress</code> to indicate its current status in the workflow.
  Some automation can be done by GitHub Projects, but make sure it switches each
  state properly.
</Text>
4. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Work on ticket</strong>: The team member assigned to the ticket begins
  work on the task or issue, updating the ticket as needed with comments,
  attachments, or other relevant information.
</Text>
5. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Pull requests</strong>: When the work on the ticket is complete, the
  team member has to create a pull request (PR) to propose the changes or fixes
  made to the codebase, tagging the entire team. The PR will reference the
  original ticket, indicating that it is the solution to the problem described
  in the ticket. It should also use the <code>Closes #issue-id</code> so that
  the issue is automatically closed when the PR is merged. Here's more
  <Link href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue">
  information</Link>.
</Text>
6. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Review and approval</strong>: Other team members review the PR,
  providing feedback, suggestions, and/or approval as appropriate. Once the PR
  is approved, it is merged into the codebase, resolving the issue described in
  the original ticket. It is important that no ticket is merged without at least
  one approval.
</Text>
7. <Text noMargin>
  <strong>Closing a ticket</strong>: The original ticket is closed, indicating
  that the issue has been resolved and the task is complete.
</Text>

<H3 id="repositories" content="Repositories" />

<Text>
  Those who work in a repository will define the working agreements: from the
  linting and formatting of the code, the merging strategy, the automation of
  CI/CD tasks and so on. 
  <br />
  When a new repository is created, make sure to add update the documentation
  accordingly. More information can be found in <Link to="/contributing">here
