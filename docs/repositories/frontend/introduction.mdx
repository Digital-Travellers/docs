  To give a bit more of context about the project, it is currently maintaned by
  the{' '}
  <Link href="https://github.com/orgs/Digital-Travellers/teams/frontend">
    <code>frontend</code> team
  </Link>. It is a monorepo that has the intention of applying concepts of
  Domain Driven Design (DDD), Hexagonal Architecture and Clean Architecture on a
  frontend project. Taking advantage of this concepts has always been a
  challenge for many reasons.

  order to provide a better development experience as well as trying to simplify
  problems that may occur for a poor architecture decision in the very
  beginning.
