<Text>
  Our documentation is written using <Link href="https://docusaurus.io/docs">Docusaurus</Link>
  {' '}as it allows us to easily write proper docs. It is expected to contain
  as much information as possible, so that the whole team has a unique
  source of truth.

<Text>
  The idea is that the team can document everything, from the code agreements,
  to how to locally set up the project X. In short, anything that can be useful
  to know!
