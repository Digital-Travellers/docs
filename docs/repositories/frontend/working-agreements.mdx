<H3 content="Local development" />

<Text>
  It is recommended that you use <code>Volta</code> to manage your Node/npm/yarn
  versions. Other node version managers are not supported. By using volta, you
  will automatically be set with the pinned node and yarn version.
</Text>

<Text>
  Another benefit of using <code>nx</code> is that it already provides many
  commands to work with the different projects. Instead of writting all commands
  in this documentation, make sure to check <code>nx</code>'s documentation. It
  is also recommended that you install <code>nx</code> globally. This can be
  done running: <code>volta install nx</code>.
  <br />
  Below are some examples:
</Text>

- <Text>
  <code>nx run site:serve</code> - This will start the local development server
  for the <code>site</code> project.
</Text>
- <Text>
  <code>nx run site:lint</code> - Will run the linter in the <code>site</code>
  {' '}project.
</Text>
- <Text>
  <code>nx run-many --target=lint --parallel=3</code> - Will run the {' '}
  <code>lint</code> command for all the projects that have a command named{' '}
  <code>lint</code>, parallelising 3 jobs each time.
</Text>
- <Text>
  <code>nx affected --target=test</code> - Will run the {' '}
  <code>test</code> command for all the projects that have been modified and
  have a <code>test</code> command defined.
</Text>

:::tip Nx caching
<Text>
  If you run the same command without changing the target project, nx will
  return the cached result for that command.
